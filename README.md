# Low-Complexity-Sum-Capacity-Maximization-for-Intelligent-Reflecting-Surface-Aided-MIMO-Systems

This is code for the paper accepted in WCL (Wireless Communications Letters) in 2022, written in MATLAB.

The code contains five files.
(1) DsmMimo.m is the core file containing all functions related to our work.
(2) irsMimo.m is the core file containing all functions related to reference [7].
(3) plot_SE_vs_Ps.m is the file to plot Figure 2.
(4) plot_iterNum_vs_N.m is the file to plot Figure 3.
(5) plot_time_vs_N.m is the file to plot Figure 4.

We can run files (3), (4), and (5). Files (1) and (2) contain functions only (encapsulated in a class), so we can't run them. Although we use MATLAB class, we don't use the concept of object-oriented programming - we merely use a static class to bundle several functions into a single file (rather than type each function on a separate file).
